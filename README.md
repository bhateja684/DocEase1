Proposed System

Medical Report Analysis
Our system uses advanced OCR technology to extract data from uploaded medical reports (PDF/images). Powered by Groq LLM and DeepSeek AI, it analyzes complex medical data and delivers simplified explanations in plain language. Users receive easy-to-understand interpretations of their results along with recommended precautionary measures and next steps.

DocEase revolutionizes access to medical care by enabling users to schedule home visits from qualified healthcare professionals. Users can select specialists based on their medical needs, choose convenient appointment times and receive confirmation and reminder notifications. The system includes a post-visit feedback mechanism to maintain service quality.
Nearby Medical Services
Through Google Maps API integration, DocEase helps users locate essential healthcare services including hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Users can filter results by specialty, services offered or insurance accepted. The platform provides critical information such as distance, directions, contact details, operating hours and even estimated wait times where available.
Emergency SOS
Our one-tap emergency assistance feature provides crucial support during medical crises. When activated, it automatically shares the user's location with emergency services, dispatches ambulances with priority status, notifies designated emergency contacts and provides responders with access to the user's critical health information to enable appropriate, timely care.
AI-powered Health Assistant
The DocEase virtual assistant, powered by Groq's language model, can answer health-related queries, conduct preliminary symptom assessments, provide medication reminders and help organize health records. This conversational interface makes healthcare information accessible and actionable for users at any time.
